Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements, including omissions, are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 3 In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we: • Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. •","pageFooters":[{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":3,"pageStart":3},"text":"Lighting the path forward"},{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":4,"pageStart":4},"text":"Abdo Solutions.com"},{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":6,"pageStart":6},"text":"See Independent Auditor's Report and Notes to the Financial Statements. 6"},{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":7,"pageStart":7},"text":"See Independent Auditor's Report and Notes to the Financial Statements. 7"}],"pageHeaders":[{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":3,"pageStart":3},"text":"Abdo Solutions.com"}],"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":7,"pageStart":3}},{"chunkId":"c6","content":"# Annual Financial Report\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.

Accordingly, net assets of the Foundation and changes therein are classified and reported as follows: Net Assets Without Donor Restriction - Those resources over which the Foundation has discretionary control. Net Assets With Donor Restriction - Those resources subject to donor imposed restrictions, which are satisfied by actions of the Foundation or passage of time, or are to be maintained permanently.\n\n## C.

The allowance estimate is derived from a review of the Foundation's historical losses based on the aging of receivables. This estimate is adjusted for management's assessment of current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts regarding future events, and any other factors deemed relevant by the Foundation. The Foundation believes historical loss information is a reasonable starting point in which to calculate the expected allowance for credit losses. As a result, management has determined that its allowance for credit losses should not be adjusted across any of its aging categories. Management expects to collect all balances.\n\n## G.

Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Foundation's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term and are included in long-term liabilities and current liabilities on the statement of financial position. ROU assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any indirect costs or rent prepayments, and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. Operating ROU assets are recorded on the face of the statement of financial position and are amortized over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments on lease commencement, the Foundation uses the implicit rate when readily determinable.","pageHeaders":[{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":15,"pageStart":15},"text":"National Ataxia Foundation Notes to the Financial Statements December 31, 2023 and 2022"},{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":16,"pageStart":16},"text":"National Ataxia Foundation Notes to the Financial Statements December 31, 2023 and 2022"}],"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":16,"pageStart":15}},{"chunkId":"c37","content":"# Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\n\n## H.

The most significant change in this standard is a shift from the incurred loss model to the expected loss model. Under the standard, disclosures are required to provide users of the financial statements with useful information in analyzing an entity's exposure to credit risk and the measurement of credit losses. Financial assets held by the Foundation that are subject to the guidance in FASB ASC 326 were trade accounts receivable. The Foundation adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023.

It emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows: Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active market that the Foundation has the ability to access, and where transactions occur within. Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include:","pageHeaders":[{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":17,"pageStart":17},"text":"National Ataxia Foundation Notes to the Financial Statements December 31, 2023 and 2022"},{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":18,"pageStart":18},"text":"National Ataxia Foundation Notes to the Financial Statements December 31, 2023 and 2022"}],"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":18,"pageStart":17}},{"chunkId":"c45","content":"# Note 3: Fair Value Investments\n\n• Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; • Inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the asset or liability; • Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. • If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology reflect management's assumptions about significant unobservable inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The asset's and liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 17","pageHeaders":[{"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":17,"pageStart":17},"text":"National Ataxia Foundation Notes to the Financial Statements December 31, 2023 and 2022"}],"pageSpan":{"pageEnd":17,"pageStart":17}},{"chunkId":"c46","content":"# Note 3: Fair Value Investments (Continued)\n\nThe methods above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair value.
