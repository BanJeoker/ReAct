Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements, including omissions, are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 3 In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we: \u2022 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. \u2022"}

The Foundation publishes Generations, an annual newsletter and a monthly e-newsletter devoted to ataxia related articles including the latest research and other information beneficial to individuals with ataxia. The Foundation also offers several webinars throughout the year on current topics relevant to the ataxia community. Other educational materials, such as books, videos and fact sheets are provided to persons with ataxia, family members and health care professionals on a \"direct request\" basis through the NAF office. The Foundation's advocacy activities, such as Hill Days, serve to raise awareness about ataxia and policy issues impacting the ataxia community. The annual ataxia conference, and sponsorship and/or participation in national and international meetings, symposiums and seminars also serve to increase ataxia awareness."}

The Foundation assists individuals and families by identifying clinical resources and making appropriate referrals for neurological care, genetic counseling and gene testing. The Foundation also assists people with locating resources within their own communities, including support groups.

Annual grants are selected through a competitive review process that includes NAF's Medical and Research Advisory Board members and over 80 leading ataxia scientists and clinicians, both domestic and international. Each year NAF awards grants to researchers from domestic and international non-profit and for-profit institutions that directly support basic and translational ataxia research through the following funding mechanisms: 1. Pioneer SCA3 Translational Research Awards: Annually granted to outstanding research proposals that aim to make significant advancements in the development of treatments and/or improvements to patient care for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3). Proposals may incorporate other forms of ataxia but must have a predominant focus on SCA3 translational or clinical research."}

The award will permit individuals to spend an additional third year in a post-doctoral position and increase chances to establish an independent ataxia research program. 5. Pre-doctoral Fellowship to Promote Diversity in Ataxia Research: Merit-based award intended to enhance research and/or clinical training of promising graduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds who are matriculated in pre-doctoral or clinical health professional degree training programs and who intend careers as scientists or other clinician-scientists within the field of ataxia. 6.

Contributions received are recorded as an increase in non-donor-restricted or donor-restricted support depending on the existence or nature of any donor restrictions. Accordingly, net assets of the Foundation and changes therein are classified and reported as follows: Net Assets Without Donor Restriction - Those resources over which the Foundation has discretionary control. Net Assets With Donor Restriction - Those resources subject to donor imposed restrictions, which are satisfied by actions of the Foundation or passage of time, or are to be maintained permanently.\n\n## C.

The allowance estimate is derived from a review of the Foundation's historical losses based on the aging of receivables. This estimate is adjusted for management's assessment of current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts regarding future events, and any other factors deemed relevant by the Foundation. The Foundation believes historical loss information is a reasonable starting point in which to calculate the expected allowance for credit losses. As a result, management has determined that its allowance for credit losses should not be adjusted across any of its aging categories. Management expects to collect all balances.\n\n## G.

Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Foundation's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term and are included in long-term liabilities and current liabilities on the statement of financial position. ROU assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any indirect costs or rent prepayments, and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments.

The most significant change in this standard is a shift from the incurred loss model to the expected loss model. Under the standard, disclosures are required to provide users of the financial statements with useful information in analyzing an entity's exposure to credit risk and the measurement of credit losses. Financial assets held by the Foundation that are subject to the guidance in FASB ASC 326 were trade accounts receivable. The Foundation adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023.

ASC Topic 820 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under an existing accounting pronouncement. It emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows: Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active market that the Foundation has the ability to access, and where transactions occur within. Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include:"}

Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology reflect management's assumptions about significant unobservable inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The asset's and liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 17"}
