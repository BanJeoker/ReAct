Basis of Accounting and Presentation  \\n \\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared using  the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with \\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   \\n \\nRevenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred. Contributions received are \\nrecorded as an increase in non -donor -restricted or donor -restricted support depending on the existence or nature of any \\ndonor restrictions.  Accordingly, net assets of the Foundation and changes therein are classified and reported as follows:  \\n \\nNet Assets Without Donor Restriction  - Those resources over which the Foundation has discretionary control.  \\n \\nNet Assets With Donor Restriction  - Those resources subject to donor imposed restrictions, which are satisfied by \\nactions of the Foundation or passage of time, or are to be maintained permanently.  \\n \\nC. Use of Estimates  \\n \\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Statesshift from the incurred loss  model to the expected loss model. Under the standard, disclosures are required to provide \\nusers of the financial statements with useful information in analyzing an entity\\u2019s exposure to credit risk and the \\nmeasurement of credit losses. Financial assets hel d by the Foundation  that are subject to the guidance in FASB ASC 326 \\nwere trade accounts receivable . The Foundation  adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023. The impact of the \\nadoption had no impact  to the financial statements and primarily resulted in new , enhanced disclosures only . \\n \\nN. Advertising  \\n \\nThe Foundation follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. Advertising expense paid to \\nvendors was $209,592  and $ 21,013  for the years ended December 31, 2023  and 2022 , respectively.  \\n \\n16 \\n National Ataxia Foundation  \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\nDecember 31, 2023  and 2022  \\n \\nNote 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  \\n \\nO.
