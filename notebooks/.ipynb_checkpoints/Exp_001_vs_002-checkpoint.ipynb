The agreement also provides that the Foundation  is responsible for a proportional share of \\nthe property's incurred ownership taxes and operating expenses. The Foundation  has determined that this lease is an \\noperating lease.  \\n \\nThe Foundation  adopted FASB ASC 842, effective January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective approach.
