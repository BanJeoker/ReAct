The Foundation considers items with a cost greater than $2,500 and a useful life \\ngreater than one year to be property and equipment. Items below $2,500 are expensed when purchased.  \\n \\nK. Functional Expenses  \\n \\nThe costs of providing program and other activities have been summarized on a functional basis in the statements ofShort -term leases will not be capitalized.  \\n \\nI. Revenue Recognition  \\n \\nThe Foundation  follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Contracts with Customers  on revenues \\nderived from its Drug D evelopment Collaborative and conference income. In the case of the C ollaborative , revenue is \\nrecognized over the collaborative period , which is over a period of one year or less. Drug Development Collaborative \\nagreements are signed annually. Earned income received in advance of the collaborative period is reported as deferred \\nrevenue. In the case of conference income, revenue is recognized at the time the event is held, which is at a point in time. \\nConference income received in advance of the event is reported as deferred revenue.  \\n \\n\\u2022 Performance Obligations  \\n \\nThe performance obligation related to Drug D evelopment Collaborative is satisfied over the collaborative period; \\ntherefore, the Foundation  recognizes revenue over a period of time on a monthly basis. The performance \\nobligation related to the conference income is satisfied once the event is held; therefore, the Foundation  \\nrecognizes revenue at a point in time.  \\n \\n\\u2022 Contract Balances  \\n \\nDeferred revenue consists of payments received in advance that relate to the Collaborative and conferences.
