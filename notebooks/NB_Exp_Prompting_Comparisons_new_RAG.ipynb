Nature of Activities\\n\\nNational Ataxia Foundation (the Foundation) was incorporated as a Minnesota nonprofit corporation in 1957. The Foundation's mission is to accelerate the development of treatments and a cure while working to improve the lives of those living with Ataxia. To further the mission, the Foundation provides services in the following program areas:\\n\\n## Education and Service\\n\\nIncreased awareness about hereditary and sporadic ataxia disorders is promoted through a variety of education programs and materials for ataxia families, researchers, physicians, allied health professionals, government agencies, legislative officials and the general public. The Foundation publishes Generations, an annual newsletter and a monthly e-newsletter devoted to ataxia related articles including the latest research and other information beneficial to individuals with ataxia. The Foundation also offers several webinars throughout the year on current topics relevant to the ataxia community. Other educational materials, such as books, videos and fact sheets are provided to persons with ataxia, family members and health care professionals on a \\\"direct request\\\" basis through the NAF office. The Foundation's advocacy activities, such as Hill Days, serve to raise awareness about ataxia and policy issues impacting the ataxia community. The annual ataxia conference, and sponsorship and/or participation in national and international meetings, symposiums and seminars also serve to increase ataxia awareness. The National Ataxia Foundation attempts to locate people and families with hereditary and sporadic ataxia in order to provide them with information about ataxia. This is accomplished by providing updated information about ataxia to the general public by maintaining a website, social media channels, newsletters, and webinars. The Foundation assists individuals and families by identifying clinical resources and making appropriate referrals for neurological care, genetic counseling and gene testing. The Foundation also assists people with locating resources within their own communities, including support groups. The Foundation's network of support groups throughout the country provides families with access to in-person and virtual meeting opportunities.\\n\\n## Research\\n\\nNAF is committed to funding cutting-edge basic and translational research into hereditary and sporadic ataxia. The goals of NAF's research program are to further elucidate the disease mechanisms of ataxias, bring early-career clinicians and scientists into ataxia research, and help drive the field towards developing treatments and a cure for ataxia. Annual grants are selected through a competitive review process that includes NAF's Medical and Research Advisory Board members and over 80 leading ataxia scientists and clinicians, both domestic and international. Each year NAF awards grants to researchers from domestic and international non-profit and for-profit institutions that directly support basic and translational ataxia research through the following funding mechanisms: 1. Pioneer SCA3 Translational Research Awards: Annually granted to outstanding research proposals that aim to make significant advancements in the development of treatments and/or improvements to patient care for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3). Proposals may incorporate other forms of ataxia but must have a predominant focus on SCA3 translational or clinical research. 2. Seed Money Research Grant: Granted primarily as \\\"seed monies\\\" to assist investigators in the early or pilot phase of their studies and as additional support for ongoing investigations on demonstration of need. It is hoped that these studies will be further developed to attract future funding from other sources. 3. Early Career Investigator Award: The Early Career Investigator Award was created to encourage early career clinical and scientific investigators to pursue a career in the field of ataxia research. 12\"}\n",

As a result, \\nthe Foundation  was required to recognize a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability on the face of the statement of \\nfinancial position for the year ended December 31, 2023  and 2022 .  \\n \\nAs noted above, the Foundation \\u2019s lease agreement calls for variable payments that were not determinable at the lease \\ncommencement and are not included in the measurement of the lease asset and liabilities. Variable lease payments \\nincurred will be recognized during the year they are inc urred as an operating expense.  \\n \\nThe ROU lease asset and corresponding lease liability were calculated utilizing a risk -free discount rate of 2.333%,This estimate is adjusted for management\\u2019s assessment of current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts \\nregarding future even ts, and any other factors deemed relevant by the Foundation. The Foundation believes historical loss \\ninformation is a reasonable starting point in which to calculate the expected allowance for credit losses. As a result, \\nmanagement has determined that its allowance for credit losses should not be adjusted across any of its aging  \\ncategories. Management expects to collect all balances.  \\n \\nG. Prepaid Expenses  \\n \\nCertain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future account periods and are recorded as prepaid items.  \\n  \\n14 \\n National Ataxia Foundation  \\nNotes to the Financial Statements  \\nDecember 31, 2023  and 2022  \\n \\nNote 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  \\n \\nH. Leases  \\n \\nThe Foundation  determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. If an arrangement contains a lease, the Foundation  \\nperforms a lease classification test to determine if the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Right -of-use (ROU) \\nassets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Foundation \\u2019s \\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities are recognized on the \\ncommencement date of the lease based o n the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term and are\"}\n",

This, combined with a decrease in receivables (specifically budget contributions receivables) and an increase in unused budget appropriations, strongly suggests that the decrease in assets is primarily due to lower budget contributions received and/or a higher rate of budget utilization.  The increase in unused appropriations further supports this, indicating that less budgeted money was spent than anticipated.  The information on cash flows helps clarify the movement of cash, but the core issue seems to be related to budgeting and contributions.

The statement of cash flows indicates this is primarily due to a net decrease in cash flows from operating activities (€1,762,128.07). This decrease is largely explained by a significant increase in &quot;unused appropriations&quot; (€2,516,892.17).  Further investigation is needed into the nature of these unused appropriations and why they increased so dramatically. The notes to the financial statements mention that unused appropriations are proposed for repayment to contributing parties.

This breakdown helps explain the large swing in the statement of cash flows.  The notes also mention that the Budget Committee recommended carrying forward unused appropriations belonging to South East European parties as contributions for the next year&#x27;s budget, while unused appropriations belonging to the EU are to be repaid. This suggests a difference in funding mechanisms and potentially explains the large amount of unused EU funds.  The reasons for the under-spending in 2021 are still unclear, but could be related to project delays, administrative hurdles, or other factors.

This is mainly due to higher running costs (€187,678.09 in 2021 vs. €105,572.94 in 2020), which include travel costs, office costs, equipment and software, other costs and services, and recruitment costs.  The notes mention that travel costs were lower than budgeted due to the pandemic and the use of private vehicles for regional travel. However, the overall increase in operating expenses suggests that other cost categories increased significantly.  The notes also mention that studies and technical assistance costs were €130,250 in 2021, while there were no such costs in 2020.  Finally, costs for other Transport Community bodies increased from zero in 2020 to €32,462.15 in 2021.\\n\\n\\nIt is important to note that the financial statements do not provide a detailed breakdown of the increase in operating expenses.  Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact reasons for the increase in each cost category.\\n'"
