All deferred revenue will be recognized over the next year. Deferred conference revenue was $9,810 and $22,290 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Deferred Drug Development Collaborative revenue was $100,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Foundation&#x27;s other revenues are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC Topic 606 and are not recorded in accordance with that standard. All contributions are considered to be available for unrestricted use unless specifically restricted by the donor. The Board&#x27;s general policy is to allocate up to thirty percent of all restricted contributions for unrestricted use unless the contribution was solicited by the Foundation for a specific purpose. The board has discretion to use this allocation or waive it. 15\\n\\n# National Ataxia Foundation\\n\\n|-|-|-|-|\\n|  |  | 2023 |  |\\n|  | Without Donor Restriction | With Donor Restriction | Total |\\n| Support and Revenue Support |  |  |  |\\n| Contributions, memorials and honorariums | $ 1,468,504 | $ 1,614,715 | $ 3,083,219 |\\n| In-kind contributions | 121,917 |  | 121,917 |\\n| Total Support | 1,590,421 | 1,614,715 | 3,205,136 |\\n| Revenue |  |  |  |\\n| Conference income | 264,816 |  | 264,816 |\\n| Earned income | 570,833 |  | 570,833 |\\n| Investment income | 144,002 |  | 144,002 |\\n| Total Revenue | 979,651 |  | 979,651 |\\n| Net Assets Released from Restrictions | 975,954 | (975,954) |  |\\n| Total Support and Revenue | 3,546,026 | 638,761 | 4,184,787 |\\n| Expenses |  |  |  |\\n| Program services |  |  |  |\\n| Research | 1,574,354 |  | 1,574,354 |\\n| Education and service | 1,146,980 |  | 1,146,980 |\\n| Drug Development Collaborative | 1,188,427 |  | 1,188,427 |\\n| Total Program Services | 3,909,761 |  | 3,909,761 |\\n| Supporting services |  |  |  |\\n| Management and general | 538,079 |  | 538,079 |\\n\\n\\n\\n&quot;}</pre>\n",

The agreement also provides that the Foundation is responsible for a proportional share of the property&#x27;s incurred ownership taxes and operating expenses. The Foundation has determined that this lease is an operating lease. The Foundation adopted FASB ASC 842, effective January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective approach. As a result, the Foundation was required to recognize a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability on the face of the statement of financial position for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As noted above, the Foundation&#x27;s lease agreement calls for variable payments that were not determinable at the lease commencement and are not included in the measurement of the lease asset and liabilities. Variable lease payments incurred will be recognized during the year they are incurred as an operating expense.\\n\\n# National Ataxia Foundation\\n\\n|-|-|-|\\n|  | 2023 | 2022 |\\n| Cash Flows from Operating Activities |  |  |\\n| Change in net assets | $ (811,671) | $ 266,396 |\\n| Adjustment to reconcile change in net assets to net cash provided by operating activities: |  |  |\\n| Realized and unrealized loss (gain) on investments | (75,701) | 194,093 |\\n| Amortization of right of use asset Changes in assets: | 31,714 | 30,992 |\\n| Accounts receivable | 48,893 | (23,917) |\\n| Prepaid expenses | (68,659) | (121,375) |\\n| Changes in liabilities: |  |  |\\n| Accounts payable | (141,982) | 388,029 |\\n| Accrued payroll and related expenses | 5,914 | 8,434 |\\n| Deferred revenue | 87,519 | (150,209) |\\n| Operating lease liability | (31,549) | (30,374) |\\n| Net Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities | (955,522) | 562,069 |\\n| Cash Flows from Investing Activities Purchase of investments Proceeds from sale of investments | (1,283,625) 1,278,699 | (1,221,776) 1,080,423 |\\n| Net Cash Used by Investing Activities | (4,926) | (141,353) |\\n| Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents | (960,448) | 420,716 |\\n|  |\\n\\n\\n\\n# Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\\n\\n## H. Leases\\n\\nThe Foundation determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. If an arrangement contains a lease, the Foundation performs a lease classification test to determine if the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Foundation&#x27;s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term and are included in long-term liabilities and current liabilities on the statement of financial position. ROU assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any indirect costs or rent prepayments, and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. Operating ROU assets are recorded on the face of the statement of financial position and are amortized over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments on lease commencement, the Foundation uses the implicit rate when readily determinable.\\n\\n&quot;}</pre>\n",

The principal issue in accounting for property, plant and equipment are timing of recognition of assets, the determination of their carrying amounts and the depreciation charges to be recognized in relation to them. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. The depreciation method used must reflect the pattern in which the asset&#x27;s future economic benefit of service potential is expected to be consumed by the entity. The depreciation charge for each period should be recognized as an expense. The Transport Community applies the straight-line method of depreciation. For specific classes of assets, the following useful lives are estimated: \\u2022 Computer software and other intangible assets - 3 years \\u2022 Computer hardware - 3 years \\u2022 Electronic devices - 3 years \\u2022 Technical equipment - 3 years \\u2022 Furniture - 5 years Assets whose purchase price is below 400 Euros are fully depreciated in the year of purchase.\\n\\n&quot;}</pre>\n",
