Deferred Drug Development Collaborative revenue was $100,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Foundation&#x27;s other revenues are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC Topic 606 and are not recorded in accordance with that standard. All contributions are considered to be available for unrestricted use unless specifically restricted by the donor. The Board&#x27;s general policy is to allocate up to thirty percent of all restricted contributions for unrestricted use unless the contribution was solicited by the Foundation for a specific purpose. The board has discretion to use this allocation or waive it. 15\\n\\n# National Ataxia Foundation\\n\\n|-|-|-|-|\\n|  |  | 2023 |  |\\n|  | Without Donor Restriction | With Donor Restriction | Total |\\n| Support and Revenue Support |  |  |  |\\n| Contributions, memorials and honorariums | $ 1,468,504 | $ 1,614,715 | $ 3,083,219 |\\n| In-kind contributions | 121,917 |  | 121,917 |\\n| Total Support | 1,590,421 | 1,614,715 | 3,205,136 |\\n| Revenue |  |  |  |\\n| Conference income | 264,816 |  | 264,816 |\\n| Earned income | 570,833 |  | 570,833 |\\n| Investment income | 144,002 |  | 144,002 |\\n| Total Revenue | 979,651 |  | 979,651 |\\n| Net Assets Released from Restrictions | 975,954 | (975,954) |  |\\n| Total Support and Revenue | 3,546,026 | 638,761 | 4,184,787 |\\n| Expenses |  |  |  |\\n| Program services |  |  |  |\\n| Research | 1,574,354 |  | 1,574,354 |\\n| Education and service | 1,146,980 |  | 1,146,980 |\\n| Drug Development Collaborative | 1,188,427 |  | 1,188,427 |\\n| Total Program Services | 3,909,761 |  | 3,909,761 |\\n| Supporting services |  |  |  |\\n| Management and general | 538,079 |  | 538,079 |\\n\\n\\n\\n&quot;}</pre>\n",

The agreement also provides that the Foundation is responsible for a proportional share of the property&#x27;s incurred ownership taxes and operating expenses. The Foundation has determined that this lease is an operating lease. The Foundation adopted FASB ASC 842, effective January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective approach. As a result, the Foundation was required to recognize a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability on the face of the statement of financial position for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As noted above, the Foundation&#x27;s lease agreement calls for variable payments that were not determinable at the lease commencement and are not included in the measurement of the lease asset and liabilities. Variable lease payments incurred will be recognized during the year they are incurred as an operating expense.\\n\\n# National Ataxia Foundation\\n\\n|-|-|-|\\n|  | 2023 | 2022 |\\n| Cash Flows from Operating Activities |  |  |\\n| Change in net assets | $ (811,671) | $ 266,396 |\\n| Adjustment to reconcile change in net assets to net cash provided by operating activities: |  |  |\\n| Realized and unrealized loss (gain) on investments | (75,701) | 194,093 |\\n| Amortization of right of use asset Changes in assets: | 31,714 | 30,992 |\\n| Accounts receivable | 48,893 | (23,917) |\\n| Prepaid expenses | (68,659) | (121,375) |\\n| Changes in liabilities: |  |  |\\n| Accounts payable | (141,982) | 388,029 |\\n| Accrued payroll and related expenses | 5,914 | 8,434 |\\n| Deferred revenue | 87,519 | (150,209) |\\n| Operating lease liability | (31,549) | (30,374) |\\n| Net Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities | (955,522) | 562,069 |\\n| Cash Flows from Investing Activities Purchase of investments Proceeds from sale of investments | (1,283,625) 1,278,699 | (1,221,776) 1,080,423 |\\n| Net Cash Used by Investing Activities | (4,926) | (141,353) |\\n| Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents | (960,448) | 420,716 |\\n|  |\\n\\n\\n\\n# Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\\n\\n## H. Leases\\n\\nThe Foundation determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. If an arrangement contains a lease, the Foundation performs a lease classification test to determine if the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Foundation&#x27;s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term and are included in long-term liabilities and current liabilities on the statement of financial position. ROU assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any indirect costs or rent prepayments, and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. Operating ROU assets are recorded on the face of the statement of financial position and are amortized over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments on lease commencement, the Foundation uses the implicit rate when readily determinable.\\n\\n&quot;}</pre>\n",

This, combined with a decrease in receivables (specifically budget contributions receivables) and an increase in unused budget appropriations, strongly suggests that the decrease in assets is primarily due to lower budget contributions received and/or a higher rate of budget utilization.  The increase in unused appropriations further supports this, indicating that less budgeted money was spent than anticipated.  The information on cash flows helps clarify the movement of cash, but the core issue seems to be related to budgeting and contributions.

The statement of cash flows indicates this is primarily due to a net decrease in cash flows from operating activities (€1,762,128.07). This decrease is largely explained by a significant increase in &quot;unused appropriations&quot; (€2,516,892.17).  Further investigation is needed into the nature of these unused appropriations and why they increased so dramatically. The notes to the financial statements mention that unused appropriations are proposed for repayment to contributing parties. This suggests a potential deliberate reduction in spending or delays in project implementation.  Additionally, there is a decrease in receivables and prepayments, which could also contribute to the overall decrease in assets. I will look into these factors.&lt;/thought&gt;\n",

This breakdown helps explain the large swing in the statement of cash flows.  The notes also mention that the Budget Committee recommended carrying forward unused appropriations belonging to South East European parties as contributions for the next year&#x27;s budget, while unused appropriations belonging to the EU are to be repaid. This suggests a difference in funding mechanisms and potentially explains the large amount of unused EU funds.  The reasons for the under-spending in 2021 are still unclear, but could be related to project delays, administrative hurdles, or other factors.

The main drivers for this increase are:\\n\\n* **Staff costs:** Increased from €710,717.99 in 2020 to €1,385,839.57 in 2021. This is mainly due to the fact that the Permanent Secretariat was fully staffed with 21 employed officials in 2021 (with the exception of January), compared to partial staffing in 2020.\\n* **Operating expenses:** Increased from €110,666.64 in 2020 to €359,125.00 in 2021. This is mainly due to higher running costs (€187,678.09 in 2021 vs. €105,572.94 in 2020), which include travel costs, office costs, equipment and software, other costs and services, and recruitment costs.  The notes mention that travel costs were lower than budgeted due to the pandemic and the use of private vehicles for regional travel. However, the overall increase in operating expenses suggests that other cost categories increased significantly.  The notes also mention that studies and technical assistance costs were €130,250 in 2021, while there were no such costs in 2020.  Finally, costs for other Transport Community bodies increased from zero in 2020 to €32,462.15 in 2021.\\n\\n\\nIt is important to note that the financial statements do not provide a detailed breakdown of the increase in operating expenses.  Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact reasons for the increase in each cost category.\\n'"
